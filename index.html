    <h1>Intro</h1>
    <p> Hi my name is Ryan Hunter and I need a job. </p>
    <p> I'm an undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Math. 
        I have a strong passion for technology, math, and all the fun 
        areas where their inherent interaction is more apparent. I'm 
        also a big space nerd. Lots of my proudest work has been done
        with my university's nano-satellite research lab. Check them 
        out here: <a href="https://www.polysat.org/">Cal Poly CubeSat</a>.
    <h1>Resume Stuff</h1>
    <p> Below is a short summation of my skills, projects, and
        past experience. </p>

                        This is a personal project I developed. It is a<br>
                        simple chess bot written in python. It's strength<br>
                        comes from a genetic algorithm that trains it<br>
                        against the moves of chess grandmasters. It's<br>
                        written in Python and heavily uses the<br>
                        python-chess library for board representation.<br>
                        Here's a list of some of the cool stuff I<br>
                        implemented for it:<br>
                        &bull; Alpha-Beta minimax algorithm<br>

                    <div class="skills">
                        Watch-Bot was developed during the 2020 MIT<br>
                        hackathon with a couple of friends. It attempts<br>
                        to identify individuals on Reddit who's posts<br>
                        indicate a high risk for suicide. I used sckitlearn<br>
                        to implement a Naive Bayesian text classifier, and<br>
                        we also implemented sentiment analysis with nueral net.<br>
                        We trained both against a self-identified group of<br>
                        users<br>
                        Here's my involvment:<br>
                        &bull; Wrote the data cleaner and vectorizer<br>
                        &bull; Implemented Polynomial Naive Bayesian classifier<br>
                        &bull; Wrote portions of interface with Reddit API<br>
