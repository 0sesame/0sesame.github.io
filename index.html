    <h1>Intro</h1>
    <p> Hi my name is Ryan Hunter and I'm a motivated software
    developer, avid learner, and <br>space nerd who is looking
        to contribute meaningfully to cutting edge science and technology.</p>
    <p> I'm an undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Math.
        I have a strong passion for<br>technology, math, and all the fun
        areas where their inherent interaction is more apparent.        
        Lots<br>of my proudest work has been done
        with my university's nano-satellite research lab.<br> Check them 
        out here: <a href="https://www.polysat.org/">Cal Poly CubeSat</a>.
    <h1>Resume Stuff</h1>
    <p> Below is a short summation of my skills, projects, and
        past experience. </p>

                        This is a personal project I developed. It is a<br>
                        simple chess bot written in python. It's strength<br>
                        comes from a genetic algorithm that trains it<br>
                        against the moves of chess grandmasters. It's<br>
                        written in Python and heavily uses the<br>
                        python-chess library for board representation.<br>
                        Here's a list of some of the cool stuff I<br>

                <h4> Star Identification Algorithms </h4>
                    <div class="skills">
                        The Cal Poly CubeSat lab has been developing a low-cost<br>
                        startracker to fly on cubesat missions. An integral<br>
                        component of a startracker is the star identification<br>
                        algorithm. This algorithm is used to map stars in a photo<br>
                        to stars in a catalog, which provides enough information<br>
                        to determine a satellite's attitude. My senior project<br>
                        revolved around studying and comparing the algorithms used to solve<br>
                        this problem.
